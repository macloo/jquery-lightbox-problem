# jQuery lightbox problem

Build a jQuery lightbox -- for jQuery beginners. This is a problem set for students who have learned 
JavaScript and jQuery only from completing the exercises at Codecademy and Code School.

Provided are three examples that demonstrate the techniques used to create a "lightbox" slideshow with jQuery. 
Of course, none of the examples provides the complete package. That's your problem to solve. Modify the two provided files, 
**yourlightbox.html** and **yourlightbox.js**, to complete the assignment. 

* [Example 1](http://macloo.github.io/jquery-lightbox-problem/example1.html)

* [Example 2](http://macloo.github.io/jquery-lightbox-problem/example2.html)

* [Example 3](http://macloo.github.io/jquery-lightbox-problem/example3.html)

You should not need to write much new CSS or make major changes to the CSS provided to you. You might need to work on 
re-positioning the arrow buttons in the CSS. 

You should not need to change anything in **yourlightbox.html**.

Your lightbox should do the following: 

1. Cover the entire visible portion of the page with a semi-transparent screen.

2. Prevent scrolling while the lightbox is visible.

3. Show a perfectly centered photo with a white border around all four sides.

4. Show left and right arrow buttons that move the user forward and backward through all the photos in a set. 
(The set can have any number of photos.)

5. Not change photos unless an arrow button is clicked.

6. Allow closing of the lightbox when the user clicks OFF the photo area. That is, click in the shaded 
overlay area to close everything.

I wrote this problem -- and then solved it myself. While solving it, [I tried to capture my 
problem-solving process](http://bit.ly/jqueryprob2). Students seem to have a lot of trouble just figuring out how 
to work out the steps to a process in writing code. I hope this makes that a little more transparent for 
beginners.
